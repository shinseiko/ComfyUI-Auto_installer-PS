> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## 🚀 A new Python version is available!
>
> This project (PowerShell) is now in **legacy / maintenance-only** mode.
> It has received a final round of improvements: **`uv` is now the primary package manager** here too, alongside resume-from-step, verbosity flags, a self-rescue bootstrapper, and CI hardening.
> A complete rewrite in Python is available with:
> - ✅ Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
> - ✅ Modern TUI interface
> - ✅ CI/CD, automated tests, Docker
> - ✅ Better dependency management (uv) *(now also in this PS version)*
>

# UmeAiRT's ComfyUI Auto-Installer (Legacy PowerShell)

This project provides a suite of PowerShell scripts to fully automate the installation and configuration of ComfyUI on Windows. The approach uses a clean installation based on `git` and a Python virtual environment (`venv`), ensuring an isolated, easy-to-update, and maintainable setup.

## Features

- **Clean Installation:** Clones the latest version of ComfyUI from the official repository and installs it in a dedicated Python virtual environment (`venv` or Miniconda).
- **Fast Dependency Management with `uv`:** Python packages are installed via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a Rust-based package manager that is significantly faster than `pip`. A `pip` fallback is used for any packages `uv` cannot handle.
- **Dependency Management:** Automatically checks for and installs necessary tools:
    - Python 3.13 (via venv or Miniconda, detected automatically)
    - Git
    - 7-Zip
    - Aria2 (for accelerated downloads)
- **CSV-Managed Custom Nodes:** Installs a comprehensive list of custom nodes defined in an external `custom_nodes.csv` file, making it simple to add new nodes.
- **Interactive Model Downloaders:** Dedicated scripts guide you with menus to download the model packs you want (FLUX, WAN, HIDREAM, LTXV), with recommendations based on your graphics card's VRAM.
- **Dedicated Update Script:** A specific `UmeAiRT-Update-ComfyUI.bat` script allows you to update ComfyUI, all custom nodes, and workflows with a single command.
- **Automated Launchers:** The project generates `.bat` files to run the installation, updates, and the final application, automatically handling administrator rights and PowerShell execution policies.
- **Supplementary modules:** The script also installs some complex modules such as: Sageattention, Triton, Visual Studio Build Tools, ...
- **Workflow included:** A large amount of workflows are pre-installed for each model.

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit).
- An active internet connection.
- CUDA 13.0.
- Python 3.13.
- GIT for Windows.

## Installation and Usage

The entire process is designed to be as simple as possible.

1.  **Download the Project:** Download `UmeAiRT-Install-ComfyUI.bat` from GitHub and put it to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\UmeAiRT-Installer`).

2.  **Run the Installer:**
    - Run the file `UmeAiRT-Install-ComfyUI.bat`.
    - It will ask for administrator privileges. Please accept.
    - The script will first download the latest versions of all installation scripts from the repository to ensure you are using the most recent version.
    - **Verbosity flags:** Add `-v` for detailed output or `-vv` for maximum verbosity (useful when troubleshooting a failed install):
      ```bat
      UmeAiRT-Install-ComfyUI.bat -v
      UmeAiRT-Install-ComfyUI.bat -vv
      ```

3.  **Follow the Instructions:**
    - The main installation script will then launch. It will install Python (if necessary), Git, 7-Zip, Aria2, and then ComfyUI.
    - Next, it will install all custom nodes and their Python dependencies into the virtual environment.
    - Finally, it will ask you a series of questions about which model packs you wish to download. Simply answer `Y` (yes) or `N` (no) to each question.

At the end of the process, your ComfyUI installation will be complete and ready to use.

## Post-Installation Usage

Three main `.bat` files will be available in your folder to manage the application:

- **`UmeAiRT-Start-ComfyUI.bat`**
    - This is the file you will use to **launch ComfyUI**. It activates the virtual environment and starts the server.

- **`UmeAiRT-Bootstrap.bat`**
    - **Self-rescue tool.** If your scripts are broken or out of date, run this to re-download all PowerShell scripts fresh from the repository. It does not touch your ComfyUI installation, models, or custom nodes. Use it before opening a bug report — it often fixes issues on its own.

- **`UmeAiRT-Download_models.bat`**
    - Run this script if you want to **add more model packs** later without reinstalling everything. It will present you with the same selection menu as the initial installation.

- **`UmeAiRT-Update-ComfyUI.bat`**
    - Execute this script to **update your entire installation**. It will update the code for ComfyUI, all custom nodes, and your workflows, and it will install any new Python dependencies if required.
    - **Resume from a specific step:** If an update fails partway through, you can skip the steps that already completed by passing `-ResumeFromStep <N>`:
      ```bat
      UmeAiRT-Update-ComfyUI.bat -ResumeFromStep 2
      ```
      | Value | Skips | Starts at |
      |-------|-------|-----------|
      | `1` | Nothing (default) | Step 1 — Update core repos |
      | `2` | Core repo update | Step 2 — Update custom nodes |
      | `3` | Core + custom nodes | Step 3 — Optimized components |
    - **Verbosity flags:** Add `-v` for detailed output (shows `[INFO]` messages and command results), or `-vv` for maximum verbosity (also prints each command line before it runs). Useful for troubleshooting:
      ```bat
      UmeAiRT-Update-ComfyUI.bat -v
      UmeAiRT-Update-ComfyUI.bat -vv
      ```
